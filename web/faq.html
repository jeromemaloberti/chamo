Here are some questions and answers about Chamo and its usage.
</p>

<prepare-toc depth="2">

<section id="scriptable" title="Using OCaml code and commands in Chamo">
<subsection id="ocaml_scriptable"
title="Chamo is OCaml-scriptable. What does it mean ?">
<p>
This means that you can fully customize Chamo with pieces of OCaml code,
the same way you can customize Emacs with lisp code. There are multiple ways to do so.
For example, you can place some code in your file
<code>~/.chamo/chamo_init.ml</code>.
This file is evaluated when <code>chamo.byte</code>
is launched. In this file, you can access any part of Chamo.
Refer to
<a href="refdoc/index.html#2_Chamomodules">the reference documentation</a>
for information about the API of the available modules.
</p>
<p>
For example, to display the "about box" at launch time, simply add to
<code>chamo_init.ml</code> the following code:
</p>
<hcode lang="ocaml">Ed_gui.show_about_dialog ();;</hcode>
<p>
The same effect could be achieved by calling the command "about" with no arguments.
To do so from OCaml code, you can use the function
<code>Ed_commands.eval_command</code>:
</p>
<hcode lang="ocaml">Ed_commands.eval_command "about";;</hcode>
<p>
Another way to evaluate OCaml code to add your own command or whatever you want is
to call the "eval" command. When called without argument, this command
prompts the user for OCaml code to evaluate. If an argument is given, it is evaluated
as OCaml code. See
<a href="#commands">here</a>
for details on commands. So, putting the following code in your file
<code>chamo_init.ml</code>:
<hcode lang="ocaml">Ed_command.eval_command "eval \"let x = 1;;\"";;</hcode>
is the same as simply putting
<hcode lang="ocaml">let x = 1;;</hcode>
</p>
<!--
<p>
You can also load compiled bytecode using the <code>Ed_eval.load_file : string -> unit</code> function.
</p>
-->
<p>
Another way to perform some customization is to use the
<code>--use</code>
command line option to indicate a file containing OCaml code to evaluate
at launch time.
</p>
<p>
From a technical point of view, the
<code>chamo.byte</code> executable includes the
<code>toplevellib.cma</code>
OCaml library which offers functions to evaluate OCaml code.
Then, some initializations are done by the
<code><a href="refdoc/Ed_eval.html">module Ed_eval</a></code>
to make the interpreter look for modules interfaces in the cameleon2 and lablgtk2
directories detected during configuration. This is done by evaluating some
<code>#directory</code> directives.
</p>
<p>
All the answer above is true for the bytecode version of Chamo
(<code>chamo.byte</code>).
It is false for the native code version
(<code>chamo.x</code>).
</p>

</subsection>
<subsection id="commands" title="What are commands ?">
<p>
Commands are functions associated to a name. The name is a string. See
<a href="#defining_commands">here</a>
 about how to define a command. The commands can take parameters,
which are strings too. The call to a command is then a string of the form:
<code>command arg1 arg2 ...</code>.
 Arguments are optional. Some commands require arguments, some don't.
Some commands will prompt the user for missing arguments.
</p>
<p>
By default, the A-x (Alt-x) keys are bound to the "prompt_command" command which
uses the minibuffer of the active window to make the user type in a command (name and arguments).
Then the text entered is given to the "command" command which parses its first argument
to separate the command name from arguments and really launches the command.
Quoting of arguments works the same way as in the shell (with simple or double quotes).
</p>
</subsection>

<subsection id="faq:chamo:defining_commands" title="How to define new commands ?">
<p>
Commands are defined in OCaml using the functions in
<a href="refdoc/Ed_commands.html">module Ed_commands</a>.
They are composed of a name, a list of parameter names, an optional description for
remaining parameters and the OCaml function which is called when the command is launched.
This function is of type
<code>string array -> unit</code>.
The parameters of the command are passed in the string array.
The indications about parameters names can be used by higher level functions
to prompt the user for missing parameters, with the names of the
parameters, so that the user knows what to enter.
</p>
<p>
Here is an example of the creation of a command which displays the message in the first
argument, or "Alert!" if there is no argument:
<hcode lang="ocaml">let alert_message args =
  let message =
    if Array.length args &lt; 1 then
      "Alert!"
    else
      Ed_misc.to_utf8 args.(0)
   in
   GToolbox.message_box "Alert message" message;;
let com = Ed_commands.create_com
   "alert_message" [| "Message to display" |] alert_message;;
Ed_commands.register com;;
</hcode>
</p>
<p>
It is useful to name and make visible the function associated to the command, so that it is
also directly available in OCaml code, rather than calling
<hcode lang="ocaml">Ed_commands.eval_command "alert_message my_message";;</hcode>
or
<hcode lang="ocaml">Ed_commands.launch_command "alert_message" [|"my_message"|];;</hcode>
Of course, calling directly the function which was first associated to the command "alert_message"
will short-circuit any redefinition of the command.
</p>
<p>
It is also possible to complete existing commands, by adding some code to execute before or
after the original code of a command. This is done with the functions
<code>Ed_commands.register_before</code>
 and
<code>Ed_commands.register_after</code>.
For example, if we want alert messages to be logged, we could use something like
<hcode lang="ocaml">
let log_message args =
  (* log the message(s) in the arguments *)
  ...
;;
Ed_commands.register_before
  (Ed_commands.create_com
     "alert_message" [|"Message to display"|] log_message);;
</hcode>
</p>
</subsection>

<subsection id="faq:chamo:commandlist" title="Which commands are available ?">
<p>
The list of available command names can be obtained with
<code>Ed_commands.available_command_names ()</code>.
 Then it is easy to obtain, for each command, the names of its parameters:
<hcode lang="ocaml"><![CDATA[let f name =
  let com = Ed_commands.get_com_or_fail name in
  print_string com.Ed_commands.com_name;
  Array.iter (fun s -> Printf.printf " (%s)" s) com.Ed_commands.com_args;
  (match com.Ed_commands.com_more_args with
     None -> ()
   | Some s -> Printf.printf " (%s...)" s
  );
  print_newline ()
;;
List.iter f (Ed_commands.available_command_names());;]]>
</hcode>
</p>
<p class="warning">
A naming convention is needed to get some consistency in command names. By now, general commands are not
prefixed. The commands relative to a sourceview mode (for example the "ocaml" mode of the "sourceview"
view) should be prefixed by the mode name (e.g. "ocaml_"). The commands relative to a view (like "sourceview"
or "odoc") should be prefixed by the view name (e.g. "sourceview_" or "odoc_"). The convention is
to separate words in command names by "_" and not "-".

<section id="configfiles" title="Configuration files">
<subsection id="rcdir" title="Where are stored the configuration files of Chamo ?">
<p>
The user's global configuration files of Chamo are stored in the
<code>~/.chamo/</code>
directory and are prefixed with "chamo.". The files are created if they don't exist.
They are human readable with an OCaml-like syntax.
</p>
<p>
There are also "local" configuration files, that is files stored in the directory
where Chamo was launched. By now, we can find:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>.chamo.sourceview.buffers</code>
 which contains the list of open buffers in the "sourceview" view, and
the position of the cursor in each of them,
</li>
<li><code>.chamo.layout.xml</code>
 which describes the layout of all open windows. This file is created
on demand by the "store_layout" command. When Chamo is launched and this file exists in the current
directory, it is read and all windows and views are created accordingly, so that you keep all your views
arranged like they were when you stored the layout.
</li>
<li><code>.chamo_init.ml</code> which is evaluated by
<code>chamo.byte</code> at launch time, after the
<code>~/.chamo/chamo_init.ml</code> file of the user; it can be used to
add some customization relative to a particular directory.
</li>
</ul>
</subsection>

<subsection id="configfileslist"
title="Wow ! There are a lot of Chamo configuration files in ~/.chamo/ !">
<p>
Indeed. But don't panic, there's a logical organisation.
</p>
<ul>
<li>In
<code>chamo.core</code>,
 you will find some values concerning internal details, like the default charset
encoding used to read/write files and convert to/from UTF-8 (Gtk2 uses UTF-8).
</li>
<li><code>chamo.gui</code>
 contains some options common to all Chamo windows, like key bindings.
</li>
<li><code>chamo_init.ml</code>
 is evaluated when
<code>chamo.byte</code>
 is launched; it contains OCaml source code. Think of it as the
<code>~/.emacs</code>
 file of Emacs.
</li>
<li><code>chamo.views</code>
 defines some options about view management, in particular the
associations between filename patterns and views, and the default view to use
when opening a file.
</li>
<li><code>chamo.odoc</code> and <code>chamo.sourceview</code>
 contain respectively the options of the "odoc" and "sourceview"
views. As you understand now, the standard name of the configuration file of a view is
<code>chamo.&lt;view name&gt;</code>.
</li>
<li>
Each available mode of the "sourceview" view has its own configuration
file named
<code>chamo.sourceview.mode.&lt;mode name&gt;</code>,
 for example
<code>chamo.sourceview.mode.ocaml</code> or
<code>chamo.sourceview.mode.changelog</code>.
</li>
</ul>
</subsection>
</section>

<section id="views" title="Views">
<subsection id="whatareviews" title="What are views ?">
<p>
Views in Chamo are different ways to edit or display files. The most commonly used
view in the "sourceview" view, which allows the edition of any text file. It is based
on GtkSourceView and can highlight syntax elements. Other views are available for
some kinds of files:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
the "odoc" view can be used to display and browse the contents of OCamldoc dump files, and
files can be open directly at the location of an element from this view (by double-clicking or
from the menu which pops-up when button 3 is pressed).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Views define also their own description of menus and key bindings. When a view has the input
focus, the menus it describes are available in the menubar of the parent window of the view,
and the key bindings it defines are handled, in addition to the key bindings common to
all Chamo windows.
</p>
</subsection>

<subsection id="chosingview" title="How do I choose which view is used to edit a file ?">
<p>
Chamo has no way to guess the view you want to use to edit a file. You have to
give some indications. This is done in the file
<code>~/.chamo/chamo.views</code>, in option
<code>view_from_filename_patterns</code>,
 by giving pairs (regular expression, view name).
The regular expressions are tried in the given
order to match the name of the file to open.
When a regular expression matches, Chamo uses the view with the associated name
to open the file. A default view is used when none of the regular expressions
match the file name. The default view name can be set with option
<code>default_view</code>.
 The default value of
<code>default_view</code>
 is "sourceview".
</p>
<p>
This file is read at launch time, so you must restart Chamo if you modified it,
or evaluate the following OCaml code to reload the values of options:
<hcode lang="ocaml">Ed_view_rc.read();;</hcode>
</p>
<p>
Values of options can also be set using OCaml code. Refer to the documentation of the
<a href="http://config-file.forge.ocamlcore.org/ocamldoc/Config_file.html">Config_file library</a>
 to manipulate the options.
For example, to add a new association between a filename pattern and a view name, use the
following OCaml code (here we add a pattern so that files with ".ocamldoc" extension are
open with the "odoc" view):
<hcode lang="ocaml"><![CDATA[let l = Ed_view_rc.filename_view_patterns#get in
Ed_view_rc.filename_view_patterns#set (("\\.*ocamldoc$", "odoc") :: l) ;;]]></hcode>
</p>
<p>
It is also possible to store the values of options, this way:
<hcode lang="ocaml">Ed_view_rc.write ();;</hcode>
</p>
</subsection>
<subsection id="sourceview" title="Can you give me some details about the &quot;sourceview&quot; view ?">
<p>
This view can be used to edit any text file. It is based on the
<a href="http://gtksourceview.sourceforge.net/">GtkSourceView</a>
 Gtk2 library.
As in Emacs, this view separates the buffers from the views on the screen. So a buffer
can be displayed in various views, and some buffers can be present but not visible.
There cannot be two different buffers on the same file. Since Gtk2 buffers uses UTF-8
strings, the contents of the edited files must be converted to UTF-8 when used in
a buffer and converted back to the file encoding when the file is saved. The default
encoding used is the one associated to the "LOCALE" environment variable, then if
it fails, the
<code>default_charset</code> option of the user's <code>~/.chamo/chamo.core</code>
 file is used. If it still fails, the user is prompted to choose an encoding among the ones
found on the system at configuration and compilation time.
</p>
<p class="warning">
Prompting the user to choose an encoding when the default ones fail
is not yet implemented.
</p>
<p>
Common manipulations of text are allowed through commands and are bound to keys.
Check your <code>~/.chamo/chamo.sourceview</code>
file for what commands are bound. Sourceview specific commands begin with "sourceview_".
</p>
<p>
Syntax highlighting in a buffer is made by the GtkSourceView library according to the
language associated to the buffer. Check the
<code>language_mime_from_filename_patterns</code> option of your file
<code>~/.chamo/chamo.sourceview</code>: these are the
associations between filename patterns and mime types. Then, the mime type is used
to retrieve the language specification defining syntax elements. Since Chamo uses
the
<ext-a href="http://gtk-extras.forge.ocamlcore.org/">module Gtksv_utils</ext-a>,
 the styles of the elements of each language are shared with the other applications
 using this module (for example
<ext-a href="http://zoggy.github.com/ocamltop-gtk">OCamltop-gtk</ext-a>).
 Styles of the "sourceview" views and syntax highlighting can be modified
 using the "Preferences" box accessible from the
menu "File/Preferences". The syntax mode of the buffer in a view is displayed
between square brackets below the view, next to the buffer name and the line and column
numbers.
</p>
<p>
Chamo sourceview buffers can also have an associated mode. A mode is composed of
a name, a description of the menus to display and the keyboard bindings to handle when
the view of the buffer has the input focus. Associations between filename patterns
and mode names are defined in option
<code>mode_from_filename_patterns</code> of the user's file
<code>~/.chamo/chamo.sourceview</code>. This means that commands
"specific to a mode" are available even on buffers with another mode associated; it is
just a matter of key bindings and menus which give direct access to commands.
Options of modes, like key bindings, are stored (by convention) in a configuration
file specific to the mode. For example, the configuration options of the "ocaml" mode
are stored in the user's file
<code>~/.chamo/chamo.sourceview.mode.ocaml</code>.
</p>
</subsection>

<subsection id="definingsourceviewmodes" title="How do I define a new sourceview mode ?">
<p>
This is done with some OCaml code. Modes are represented by objects of class type
<code>Ed_sourceview.mode</code>.
Then, an instance of your mode class must be registered with
<code>Ed_sourceview.register_mode</code>. Then, add some association between a filename
pattern and your mode name and it's ok. Have a look at the code of another mode, e.g.
<a href="refdoc/Ed_mode_ocaml.html">the ocaml mode</a>
 (implementation is <a href="refdoc/code_Ed_mode_ocaml.html">here</a>,
implementation of the management of the configuration file is
<a href="refdoc/code_Ed_mode_ocaml_rc.html">here</a>).
</p>
</subsection>

<subsection id="availablemodes" title="What modes are availables ?">
<p>
By now, there are not a lot of modes. Here is a list of the available modes,
with the commands it provides through a key binding indicated between parenthesis:
</p>
<ul>
<li>"ocaml": 'ocaml_indent_line' (Tab),
'ocaml_indent_buffer' (C-x C-Tab), 'ocaml_switch_file' (C-x C-a),
'ocaml_display_type_annot' (A-t),</li>
<li>"makefile": 'sourceview_insert "\t"' (Tab),</li>
<li>"changelog": 'changelog_new_day_entry' (C-x a), 'sourceview_insert "\t"' (Tab).</li>
</ul>
<p class="warning">
Contributions (new modes or new commands) are very welcome !
</p>

</subsection>
</section>

<section id="keyboardshortcuts" title="Key bindings">
<subsection id="ksdefinition" title="How/where are key bindings defined ?">
There are various sets of key bindings:
<ul>
<li>
Chamo-wide key bindings, usable in all Chamo edition windows, whatever the active view is;
these key bindings are defined in the file <code>~/.chamo/chamo.gui</code>.
</li>
<li>
key bindings associated to a kind of view; these bindings are defined in the file
<code>~/.chamo/chamo.V</code> where <code>V</code>
 is the name of a view. So, the bindings of "sourceview" views are defined in the file
<code>~/.chamo/chamo.sourceview</code>.
 The bindings associated to a kind of view are active only when the active view is of
this kind.
</li>
<li>
sourceview mode specific bindings; these are active only when a mode is selected in
the active sourceview; they are defined in the file
<code>~/.chamo/chamo.sourceview.mode.M</code> where <code>M</code>
 is the name of the mode, such as "ocaml".
</li>
</ul>
<p>
All these files are created with default values if they don't exist when Chamo is launched.
</p>
<p>
The final set of active key bindings is the union of global key bindings and the ones
of the active view (with eventually the ones of the active mode).
</p>
</subsection>

<subsection id="kscommands"
 title="Where can I find a list of key specification to define my own bindings ?">
<p>
The key identifiers usable in configuration files can be found
<ext-a href="https://forge.ocamlcore.org/plugins/scmgit/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=gtk-extras/gtk-extras.git;a=blob_plain;f=src/configwin_keys.ml;hb=HEAD">here</ext-a>,
 in value
<code>keysym_to_name</code>.
You should be able to find the corresponding string; for example "page up" will
be referenced with the identifier "Page_Up".
</p>
</subsection>

<subsection id="kscommandsavailable"
title="How can I know the list of available commands I can associate a key binding to ?">
<p>
Most of predefined commands are already bound to a key combination, so you
can already have a look at the various configuration files for command names.
If you don't find what you're looking for, you can execute the following command
in a bytecode version of chamo:
<hcode lang="ocaml">eval "Ed_commands.available_command_names ()"</hcode>
</p>
<p>
This command will evaluate the given ocaml expression, which returns the list
of names of registered commands. The list is displayed in the ocaml evaluation
output window.

<section id="troubleshooting" title="Troubleshooting">
<subsection id="noocamlsyntaxhighlight"
title="I have strange syntax highlighting when I edit my OCaml source files in Chamo.">
<p>
Sourceviews in Chamo are based on
<ext-a href="http://gtksourceview.sourceforge.net/">GtkSourceView 2.X</ext-a>,
 which uses language-specs files to know what to highlight (keywords, comments, ...).
GtkSourceView 2.X comes with a language description file for  Objective Caml, but
this one may not be as you like. For example, you may prefer to have different
styles for definition keywords and expression keywords, or have identifiers containing
integers displayed correctly (without a different style for the integer part...).
In this case, you can copy the files below in your directory
<code>~/.mlgtksourceview2/</code>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code><a href="ocaml.lang">ocaml.lang</a></code>
 is an alternative description of ocaml syntax elements. This description is called
"OCaml" and differs from the "Objective-Caml" style coming with the
GtkSourceView 2.X installation,
</li>
<li>
<code><a href="scheme_chamo.xml">scheme_chamo.xml</a></code>
 is a gtksourceview2 style scheme called "Chamo" specifically handling ocaml styles defined in
<code>ocaml.lang</code>;
 you can customize it to fit your preferences. To activate this style sheme,
 choose this scheme in the
<em>Files/Preferences</em>
 menu.
</li>
</ul>
</subsection>

<subsection id="encodingproblem"
title="When I open a file, some characters are badly displayed;
it seems there is an encoding problem. How is the encoding of files handled ?">
<p>
By default, Chamo considers that files are encoded as specified in file
<code>~/.chamo/chamo.core</code>
 (the default value when this file is created is ISO8859-1). When a file is
open, Chamo converts the contents of the file from this encoding to UTF-8 to
display it correctly in Gtk windows. If you want to open a file which is
in a different encoding, you can use the command
<code>open_file_with_encoding</code>
 which will let you specify the encoding of the file to open. You can also
change the default encoding used, by modifying the value in the file
<code>~/.chamo/chamo.core</code>.
